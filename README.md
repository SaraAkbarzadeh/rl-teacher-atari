# RL-Teacher-Atari

`rl-teacher-atari` is an extension of [`rl-teacher`](https://github.com/nottombrown/rl-teacher), which is in turn an implementation of of [*Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03741) [Christiano et al., 2017].

As-is, rl-teacher only handles MuJoCo environments. This repository is meant to extend that functionality to Atari environments and other complex Gym environments. Additionally, this repository extends and augments the code in various ways.

(TODO: Describe the changes in depth.)
